A collection of handwritten notes to help you in your adventure.
Be it on a bike/motorcycle or even your own two legs! 


The collection is divided into 3 parts.

2. Machine
3. Universe

Project Structure:

	This project is divided into 3 sections.

	- Final folder contains contents ready for usage (Content undergone review against its facts , usability , information)
		- Final folder would be in markdown format 
	- Drafts folder which is under active development and needs either more info or awaiting review.
		- Markdown format where text and other media are still being curated
	- Info folder where anyone suggest their information they find usefull or helped them in one way or another.
		- Content in any text/image format can be used and videos are allowed as links due to its very limited use.
		- Mention to which section this information would be best suited to in your heading 

Eventhough content allowed has images and Videos(Links) , we would urge you to provide information in a textual format since it comes best in hand on your journey.
